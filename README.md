# Your pokedex journey game

It is a game I made with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

For this project I used the pok√© API (https://pokeapi.co/) to obtain data for the first 150 pokemons. The purpose of the game is to catch all the 150 pokemons to become a pokemon master, like in the tv series.

## Where can you find the game?

The project has been deployed on Heroku and can be viewed here: http://yourpokedexjourney.herokuapp.com/

## How does the game work?

1. Click on the 'ON' button to start the game and to use your pokedex.
2. Click the green button to activate Pickachu.
3. When you clicked the green button, you can move Pickachu with the arrow keys. Keep moving Pickachu untill a pokeball appears. 
4. Congratulations! You catched your first pokemon! The pokemon will be saved in your pokedex.
5. Repeat the process till you have found all the 150 pokemons.

*Use the white buttons to look through your pokedex.

*Click on the pokeball in the navigation bar or top right of the website to see all the 150 pokemons. When you captured a pokemon, the opacity of the card is set lower. You can keep track which pokemon you still have to catch and which pokemon you already captured.

## Other information about the project

*The website is not responsive. You cannot play the game on your mobile phone or tablet. It is only availabe for the computer.

*When you refresh the page, the captured pokemons will still be in your pokedex. It works with local storage.
